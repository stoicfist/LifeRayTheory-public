## 🧭 Overview

*Life Rays & Fragment Chains* is a theoretical framework exploring how experience, meaning, and cognition emerge through resonant encounters between systems.  
Developed outside institutional settings, the project seeks to bridge phenomenology, systems theory, cognitive abstraction, and affective synchrony.

The **life ray** is introduced as a model of directional intentionality — a projection of life’s attention into shared and private space.  
**Fragment chains** describe how lived experiences organize into networks of resonance, producing continuity, memory, and identity.

The theory unfolds across several levels:
- **Phenomenological:** experience as a field of projection and return  
- **Systemic:** interaction between self and environment as information flow  
- **Cognitive:** pattern formation, humor, and memory as resonant asymmetries  
- **Philosophical:** reinterpreting encounter as the minimal structure of meaning

## 🧩 Current Paper (Part I: Theoretical Framework)

This repository hosts the **theoretical foundation** of the Life Ray model.  
It introduces the conceptual architecture and links to ongoing analytical, applied, and integrative studies.  

The section on humor was inspired by materials shared by **Don L. F. Nilsen**,  
drawing connections between conceptual abstraction, epistemic framing, and humorous cognition.

## 🧠 Research Context

This project is conducted as part of an ongoing series of **independent conceptual investigations** into:
- resonance and cognition,  
- systems of encounter,  
- affective synchronization,  
- and emergent pattern formation.

The approach combines philosophical reasoning with structural and cognitive modeling.  
It is not affiliated with any university or institution.
